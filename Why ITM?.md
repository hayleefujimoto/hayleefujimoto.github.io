I chose to add Management Information Systems as a major because I believe it complements my other major, which is marketing. In general, I believe it is a good major to pursue as it combines both the business world and technology. The skills you acquire as an MIS major will also open up numerous options for future professions. Since my goal in the future is to pursue project management or data analysis, I see MIS as a major that will be highly beneficial, especially in our continuously evolving digital world.
