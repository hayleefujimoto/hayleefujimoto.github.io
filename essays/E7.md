## Course Goals ITM 352 has the following goals:

## Acquiring basic programming skills in an IT context
Before starting ITM 352, I didn't know much about programming. Completing Assignment 1 showed me how far I've come in learning basic programming skills. I used what we learned in class and in labs to build a web page for displaying my products. I got to practice using HTML and JavaScript, which helped me understand them better.

## Understanding why MIS people need basic programming skills and knowledge
Assignment 1 would be a great example as it shows why it's important to have at least some basic programming skills and knowledge. Although we had help with assignments where all we had to do was edit basic code, we wouldn't have been able to execute it without those fundamental coding skills.

## Gaining hands-on experience in developing software applications
The WODS and assignments is where I believe I gained the most hands-on experience in developing software applications. In the WODS is where we first learned how to create the store webpage and the basic skills we needed to update it to create a more improved version in the assignments. Although I struggled with these assignments I was able to gain a lot of hands-on experience.

## Experiencing first-hand MIS problems and solutions
I'd say that Assignment 2 was definitely the most challenging assignment for me. It's where I encountered the most MIS problems and had to work through finding solutions. I learned firsthand how crucial paying attention to the little details is, and why it's important to keep track of what your code is doing to avoid messy situations. Throughout this assignment, I observed how the terminal, ChatGPT, and solutions from Professor Port helped handle the problems and execute the solutions.


## Experiencing and understanding first-hand project management, working in teams, software development issues
While I didn't have the chance to work in a team for Assignment 2 as I completed it independently, I still sought assistance from others to gain different perspectives when encountering issues. Through collaborative problem-solving, I was able to address challenges and gain insights into project management and software development issues firsthand, both in Assignment 1 and Assignment 2.

## Gaining confidence in addressing MIS problems
As I mentioned earlier in section 1.4, I encountered MIS problems not only during assignments but also during WODs. Gradually, I gained confidence in identifying potential issues and knew where to seek assistance. ChatGPT played a significant role, occasionally aiding in problem identification and resolution.

## Course Elements and Personal Engagement

## What did you learn from creating a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352?
Building a professional portfolio and using it in ITM 352 seemed tough at first, but as I got more experience, I found it helpful, especially in learning how to use GitHub. GitHub was great for organizing our projects and essays. The portfolio also made me think about what I learned and how I improved during the class.

## What did you gain from doing the WODs?
The WODs were all about using what we learned in the labs. Doing them made me more confident as I went along, especially once the screencasts stopped. Even though some were tough and took me a while to finish, they showed me that I can handle programming on my own and figure out solutions to problems.

## Were the quizzes helpful in preparing you for the labs?
I found the quizzes somewhat helpful for lab preparation, but I believe there might be better alternatives available. Perhaps a system that allows for multiple reviews would be beneficial. I often had difficulty following the quizzes on Laulima and found it challenging to access information afterward.

## What did you learn from doing the labs?
The labs taught me the basics of coding and programming, showing what each code can do, its limits, and potential. This knowledge came in handy for both the Assignments and WODs.

## What did you learn from doing the essays?
The essay taught me how to format and publish them using GitHub. Additionally, it allowed me to reflect on my learning and organize my thoughts effectively.

## What did you learn from doing Assignment 1 and Assignment 2?
Completing Assignments 1 and 2 taught me two important lessons. Firstly, I saw how all the lessons from the labs and WODs came together. Secondly, I learned that effective time management is important. These assignments often required troubleshooting, which took up a lot of time. Lastly, these assignments helped me grasp coding basics, which are essential for understanding website functionality. Despite their difficulty, Assignments 1 and 2 were valuable learning experiences.

## Challenges and Achievements

## Detail the specific challenges you encountered during the course, such as understanding new programming concepts, completing WODs, web application development assignments.Explain how you overcame these challenges and the strategies that helped you succeed.
While working in class, I encountered a few challenges, particularly in pinpointing issues. I often found myself frustrated and making unnecessary large changes when the problem was minor. This frustration was most evident during the WODs, where I had to redo recordings multiple times. Additionally, understanding when to use specific code proved challenging for me. However, I overcame these obstacles by persisting and pushing through, sometimes taking breaks to clear my mind. When unsure about code usage, I found help in the videos, lectures, and ChatGPT resources provided.

## Highlight any particular achievements or milestones in the course that were significant to you.
I didn't perceive any significant achievements or milestones throughout the course, as I felt my performance was average overall. However, I believe there's always room for improvement, and completing each task felt like a personal accomplishment. If I were to identify one achievement, it would be Assignment 2. Despite the challenges and the considerable time it took to finish, completing it was immensely satisfying. Seeing the final result I was proud to see that all my work paid off.

## Skill Development and Application

## Reflect on the three skill levels outlined in the course (syntactic, algorithmic, application) and discuss your progression through these levels.Describe how the hands-on experience with web-based e-service applications enhanced your understanding and confidence in handling MIS issues.

Syntactic:
Understanding coding languages and basic topics was challenging initially, especially with limited prior experience and the brisk pace of the class. Despite feeling overwhelmed, I persevered. While I still encounter difficulties and make errors, my grasp of syntaxes such as arrays, objects, and punctuation has improved significantly.

Algorithmic:
Working with algorithms was a tough yet rewarding experience. Practices like determining the day of the week and completing Assignment #2 provided valuable insight and experience. They helped me break tasks into manageable steps and understand the sequential nature of problem-solving.

Application:
I feel most comfortable with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript for dynamic programs, largely due to the hands-on experience gained from Assignments #1 and #2. Despite some limitations, I am capable of creating e-commerce sites with my current knowledge.

The hands-on experience with web-based e-service apps greatly enhanced my confidence in handling MIS issues. Through troubleshooting errors and debugging while building websites, I've learned valuable lessons and become more adept at problem-solving. My comfort level has increased as I've gained insights from my mistakes.

## Use of AI (e.g. ChatGBT)

## Discuss how use of AI enhanced your learning and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI effectively.
AI really helped enhance your learning and productivity, as it helped me understand what the code meant and sometimes helped me identify the error. I believe I asked chat gpt for help the most when completing assignment 1 and 2. I would ask to search through my code and show me why this *blank* isn't executing the way I wanted and it would show me where there might be an error. I would also ask it to describe the code given so I could get a better understanding or to show me what a code might look like. 

## Discuss how use of AI inhibited your learning or and productivity. Give specific examples of how you used AI ineffectively.
AI sometimes confused me and slowed down my learning and productivity, especially during Assignment 1 and 2. When I asked for help in finding errors, it sometimes got things wrong, which messed up my workAnother example would be when I asked it to help me fix the error or what I could do to fix it, it would give me big chunks of unnecessary code that would sometime disrupt my overall webpage or just be zombie code.
